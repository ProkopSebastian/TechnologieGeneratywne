  Sugerowany przepis: Spicy Pork Belly Sliders
  Składniki: ['1 medium onion, thinly sliced', '1 cup gochujang (Korean red chili paste)', '¼ cup soy sauce', '¼ cup minced garlic', '¼ cup sugar', '3 tablespoons sake', '2 tablespoons mirin', '2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil', '2 pounds skinless pork belly, sliced ¼ inch thick (ask the butcher to slice it) and cut into 2-inch squares', 'Unsalted butter', '12 slider buns', 'Mayonnaise', '2 English cucumbers', 'peeled', 'halved lengthwise', 'seeded', 'and sliced into matchsticks']...
  Cały przepis: To make the marinade, put the onion, gochujang, soy sauce, garlic, sugar, sake, mirin, and sesame oil in a bowl and mix well to combine. Add the pork and turn to coat the meat. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
The next day, set a large sauté pan over medium heat. Once it’s hot, add the pork, working in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan and leaving any liquid in the bowl. Cook, stirring occasionally and flipping the meat, until lightly caramelized and golden brown on both sides, about 10 minutes. (If you overcrowd the pan, the meat will steam instead of sear.) Transfer to a platter.
When the meat is cooked, open the buns, butter the interiors, and toast them until they are a light golden brown.
To serve, spread both cut sides of each bun with a healthy smear of mayo and pile the spicy pork generously on the bottoms of the buns. Top with the sliced cucumbers. Serve immediately.
The pork belly must be marinated overnight. You can also grill the pork on an outdoor grill over a high fl...

Place cucumbers in a colander or sieve set in or over a large bowl; sprinkle with 1 tsp. salt and toss to combine. Let sit while you make the meatballs. (It will seem like a lot of cucumbers at first, but they will shrink down as they drain.)
Meanwhile, drizzle 2 Tbsp. oil over a large rimmed baking sheet. Arrange pine nuts in an even layer on another rimmed baking sheet (use a quarter-sheet if you have one!).
Finely chop ¼ cup olives. Transfer to a large bowl and add egg, garlic, panko, parsley, 1½ tsp. salt, and ¼ tsp. red pepper flakes; season with black pepper. Drain raisins and add half to bowl; mix well to combine. Add pork and gently mix with your hands to incorporate.

Meanwhile, trim ends of zucchini and cut crosswise into 3 pieces about 2" long. Cut each piece lengthwise into ¼"-thick planks. Stack a few planks and slice lengthwise into ¼"-thick matchsticks (about the size of a skinny french fry). Transfer zucchini to a colander set in a medium bowl.

Meanwhile, whisk both flours, baking powder, baking soda, and 1¼ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a medium bowl.
Scrape butter into a large bowl and add brown sugar and granulated sugar. Whisk vigorously until butter is absorbed into sugar, about 30 seconds. Add egg, then egg yolks, one at a time, whisking to combine after each addition; whisk in vanilla. Mixture should look much lighter in color and be almost creamy.
Add dry ingredients and use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to stir until just incorporated and almost no dry streaks remain. Set aside a handful of chocolate, then add remaining chocolate to batter. Gently mix just to evenly distribute.

  Sugerowany przepis: Spiral Ham in the Slow Cooker
  Składniki: ['1 (6- to 7-pound) bone-in, hickory-smoked, uncured fully cooked ham', '5 medium parsnips, peeled and halved lengthwise', '5 medium carrots, peeled and halved lengthwise', '1 cup maple syrup', '2 cups unsweetened apple juice', '½ cup packed dark brown sugar', '½ cup smooth Dijon mustard', '½ cup grainy Dijon mustard', '2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar', 'Kosher salt (if needed)']...
  Cały przepis: Pour 3 cups of water into a 7-quart slow cooker. Add the ham, cut-side up, as well as the parsnips and carrots.

Cook on high, uncovered, for 30 to 45 minutes, then cover the slow cooker and cook on low until the ham is tender, 3 to 4 hours. Hams vary in size and tenderness, so be patient. When it’s tender, the meat should come off the bone with very little resistance. Taste a small piece for tenderness.
Transfer the ham and vegetables to a deep serving platter (reserve the liquid in the pot). Use a pair of kitchen shears or scissors to cut the slices of ham off the bone and let them fall onto the platter. Stir both kinds of mustard and the vinegar into the cooking liquid left in the slow cooker and taste for seasoning—the sauce may or may not need salt. Pour the liquid over the ham and vegetables, and serve....
