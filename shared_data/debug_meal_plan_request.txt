  Suggested recipe: Pineapple-Glazed Ham
  Ingredients: ['1/2 pineapple, peeled, sliced into rings', '1 large orange, sliced into thick rounds', '1 (10-lb.) cured smoked bone-in ham or 6-lb. cured boneless ham', '3 cups pineapple juice', '1/2 cup apple cider vinegar', '1/2 cup (packed) light brown sugar', '1/4 cup hot sauce', 'Maraschino cherries (for serving)']...
  Full recipe: Preheat oven to 300°F. Stack 2–3 sheets of foil ample enough to cover ham on a work surface and arrange pineapple and orange slices on top in a single layer. Set ham on fruit (if using a bone-in ham and it has a fat cap, score very lightly, making cuts about 3/4" apart) and wrap up tightly. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a large rimmed baking sheet and bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of ham registers 115°F, 3–3 1/2 hours for boneless, 3 1/2–4 hours for bone-in.
Meanwhile, bring pineapple juice, vinegar, brown sugar, and hot sauce to a boil in a large saucepan. Reduce heat; simmer, swirling occasionally, until thick enough to coat a spoon. Keep warm.
Remove ham from oven and increase oven temperature to 425°F. Unwrap ham, peeling back the foil so it covers the baking sheet (this will make for easy cleanup). Once oven is at 425°F, baste ham with warm glaze and return to oven. Bake, brushing with more glaze every 3 minutes or so, until glaze is d...

  Suggested recipe: Food Processor Butter
  Ingredients: ['2 cups heavy cream, preferably not ultra-pasteurized', '1 tsp. kosher salt (optional)', '2 Tbsp. sugar', '1 Tbsp. ground cinnamon', '1 tsp. finely grated orange zest', '1/4 cup parsley leaves with tender stems, finely chopped', '1 tsp. finely grated garlic', '1 tsp. finely grated lemon zest', '2 Tbsp. toasted sesame seeds', '2 tsp. coarsely grated black pepper', '2 tsp. smoked paprika', 'Cheesecloth']...
  Full recipe: Process cream in a food processor until the butter solids have separated from the buttermilk and you see lots of little clumps of butter clinging together distinctly separated from thin milky liquid, 4–7 minutes (unpasteurized cream will separate more quickly). Carefully drain buttermilk; reserve for another use.
Remove jar with blade still attached. Pour cold water over butter solids left in food processor jar, then drain. Repeat until water runs clear, 3–4 times. Pour off as much water as possible out of jar of food processor, using your hands to hold the butter solids in place while you pour. Continue to process until butter forms a solid ball, about 2 minutes. Pour off water again, then add salt (if using) and process to combine.
If making compound butter, add ingredients for chosen flavor and process until fully incorporated.
Transfer butter to a medium bowl lined with a double layer of cheesecloth. Gather cheesecloth up around butter and twist to squeeze until no more liquid runs...

  Suggested recipe: Pigs-in-a-Blanket with Sauerkraut and Mustard
  Ingredients: ['1 large egg', 'One 14- to 17-ounce box of puff pastry (preferably all-butter), thawed according to package directions', '2 pounds fully cooked German-style sausage such as bockwurst or bratwurst, halved lengthwise if thick, and cut into 32 pieces (about 2 1/2 inches each)', '1/3 cup whole-grain mustard', '1/3 cup drained sauerkraut', 'Caraway seeds', 'for sprinkling']...
  Full recipe: Preheat the oven to 400°F. Set racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Line two 13x18-inch baking sheets with parchment paper. In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water. Prep the ingredients for the filling and set aside.
If using a 17-ounce puff pastry package, roll each sheet to a 9x12-inch rectangle. Cut each piece lengthwise into eight 1 1/2-inch wide strips. Cut each strip crosswise into two pieces, about 4 1/2 inches long. You should have 32 pieces of pastry.
Spread the center of each piece of pastry with 1/2 teaspoon mustard and top with 1/2 teaspoon sauerkraut. Brush one narrow end of the pastry with egg wash, add one piece of sausage, and roll to enclose. Return to parchment-lined baking sheets. Brush the top of each pastry with egg wash and sprinkle with caraway seeds, seam-side down. Chill in refrigerator for 15 minutes. Bake until golden brown and puffed, 23 to 27 minutes....

  Suggested recipe: Smoky Dry-Rubbed Pork Steaks
  Ingredients: ['2 tsp. fennel seeds', '2 Tbsp. light brown sugar', '4 tsp. kosher salt', '1 Tbsp. smoked Spanish paprika', '2 tsp. garlic powder', '2 tsp. mustard powder (preferably Colman’s English)', '1 lemon', '1 orange', '1 (4-lb.) boneless pork butt, cut crosswise against the grain into two or three 2"-thick steaks', '3 Tbsp. grapeseed', 'sunflower', 'or vegetable oil']...
  Full recipe: Toast fennel seeds in a dry small skillet over medium-low heat, tossing occasionally, until nutty and fragrant, 1–2 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and coarsely chop, then transfer to a small bowl. Add brown sugar, salt, paprika, garlic powder, and mustard powder. Zest lemon and orange (reserve zested lemon and orange), add zest to bowl, and toss to combine. Rub pork all over with dry rub, pressing to adhere as much as possible to the surface. Place steaks on a wire rack set over a sheet pan and chill at least 3 hours and up to 24.
Preheat oven to 325°F. Thoroughly pat dry pork steaks. Heat a large ovenproof skillet (preferably cast iron) over high until smoking. Drizzle steaks with oil and rub to cover all surfaces. Working in batches if needed, sear steaks on all sides until deeply browned and lightly charred, 4–5 minutes per side. (Keep a good eye on them; they’ll take on color relatively fast because of the sugar.) Transfer steaks to a plate. Reserve skillet.
Wipe out any accu...
